# password-generator

## How it works
* When the button is clicked a series of window prompts will come up
* the first one asks how many characters the password should be
* if the value inputed isn't between 8 and 128 they have to try again
* it then asks if there should be uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and/or numbers
* the application then generates a password at random following the perameters set around it
* it then returns the password value back to the empty div
